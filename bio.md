I am a software developer at Microsoft where I am part of [PowerApps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com), a platform which lets you build apps without any coding experience. Previously I was an undergrad at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, where I was advised by [Dr. Subiman Kundu](http://maths.iitd.ac.in/people/faculty/subiman_kundu.php).
