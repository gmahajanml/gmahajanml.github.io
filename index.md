I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego advised by [Prof. Tajana Simunic Rosing](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~trosing/). Before that I was a software developer at Microsoft, Redmond where I was part of [PowerApps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com), a platform which lets you build apps without any coding experience. I received my M.S. and B.S from the Mathematics Department at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, where I was advised by [Dr. Subiman Kundu](http://maths.iitd.ac.in/people/faculty/subiman_kundu.php).
