The task of modeling how the value
of a response \\(y\\) changes in response to changes in an 
explanatory variable \\(x\\) is known as regression/regression problem.  

An example of a regression problem would be the prediction
of the yield in a chemical manufacturing process in which the inputs consist
of the concentrations of reactants, the temperature, and the pressure.
