    My research interests are in the field of Automated Reasoning and Measure Theory.
    I am particularly interested in researching solutions for following shortcomings of current generation of deep learning techniques:
  <ul>
    <li>Non-existence of human understandable concepts learned by the neural networks makes it difficult to test the technique or learning. </li>  
    <li>Current deep learning techniques lack the ability to reason on an abstract level,  which makes transferring the learning difficult. </li>
  </ul>
As part of my research,  I want to come up with a model which is essentially a learned mapping from low level outputs from  neural  networks  to  human  understandable  concepts.
